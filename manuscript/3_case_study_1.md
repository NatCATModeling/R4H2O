# Case Study: Water Quality Regulations {#casestudy1}
The case study for this first session is about assessing compliance with water quality regulations. The example data for this case study is a set of turbidity measurements for the [Laanecoorie water network](https://www.coliban.com.au/site/root/your_town/loddon/laanecoorie.html), situated just over 100 km North of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. The plant extracts water from the Laanecoorie reservoir, located on the Loddon River.

The water network is divided into four zones, each of which has a set of sample points installed just upstream of the water meter. Each of these sample points has a unique identifier that consists of three digits (090 for the Laanecoorie system), a letter to indicate the zone, and two digits to indicate the number of the sample point.

The laboratory service provider regularly samples these taps and tests the water for a range of parameters, including turbidity. All turbidity measurements are recorded for a specific sample point at a certain date. The data set is already cleaned and is ready for analysis.

## Turbidity
Turbidity is a measurement of the cloudiness of the water. In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that consumers develop gastrointestinal diseases. Particles in the water scatter light, which is used to measure turbidity with a nephelometer (from the Greek *nephÃ©la*, "cloud"). Turbidity is expressed in dimensionless Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). The video below gives a detailed overview of how to measure turbidity in liquids.

## Problem Statement
The states of Australia each have their own water quality regulations. The state regulations refer to the federal [Australian Drinking Water Quality Guidelines](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-drinking-water-guidelines).

The Victorian regulations for water quality, the [Safe Drinking Water Regulations](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/water/drinking-water-in-victoria/drinking-water-legislation) 2015, specify that "the 95^th^ percentile of results for samples in any 12 months must be less than or equal to 5.0 Nephelometric Turbidity Units".

In a separate [guidance document](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/Api/downloadmedia/%7BA1F6D255-D5C7-4B7E-AAE5-8B7451EDE81A%7D), the Victorian regulator also specifies that the percentile for turbidity should be calculated with the 'Weibull Method'.

You are writing the annual report to the regulator about the Laanecoorie system. What was the 95^th^ percentile of turbidity for each of the water zones in the system?

## Methodology
Good data science needs to be valid and reliable. The validity and reliability of the measurements in this case study relate to the design, installation and maintenance of the instrument to measure turbidity.

The soundness of good data science also requires an appropriate methodology to analyse the data. This case study has some specific requirements concerning how to analyse the data. The guidance document from the regulator raises two questions: What is the Weibull method? How do you implement this method in R?

The process to determine a percentile consists of three steps (McBride, [2005](http://amzn.to/2k8shr8)):

1. The numbers are placed in ascending order: `y_1, y_2, \ldots y_n`$.
2. Calculate the rank (`r`$) of the required percentile.
3. Interpolate between adjacent numbers: `x_p=(1-r_{frac})Y_{r_{int}}+r_{frac}Y_{r_{int+1}}`$

Where:
* `r_{frac}`$: Decimal fraction of the ranking.
* `r_{int}`$: Rounded ranking.

With 52 ranked weekly turbidity samples, the 95^th^ percentile is logically between sample 49 and 50 (0.95 times 52). However, this method is only valid for normally-distributed samples. 

Statisticians have defined several methods to determine percentiles. The difference between these approaches is the rule to determine the rank `r`$. Hyndman & Fan ([1996](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222105754_Sample_Quantiles_in_Statistical_Packages)) give a detailed overview of nine methods of calculating percentiles or quantiles. This paper gives the Weibull method the less poetic name `\hat{Q}_6(p)`$ because it is the sixth option in their list. Waloddi Weibull, a Swedish engineer famous for his statistical distribution, was one of the first to describe this method. The rank of a percentile `p`$ is given by:

```$
r_{weibull} = p(n + 1)
```
For a sample of 52 turbidity tests, the percentile thus lies between ranked result number 50 and 51. This method gives a higher result than the method described above. This method is suitable for positively skewed samples, as is often the case with water quality data. We often see a lot of low values, with the occasional spikes of high values.

Please note that there is no one correct way to calculate percentiles. The most suitable method depends on the distribution of the population and the purpose of the analysis. In this case study, the method is prescribed by the regulator.

## Analysing the case study
The sections below explain how to analyse an example data set with turbidity data for compliance with the Victorian Safe Drinking Water Regulations. The data and the code is available in the [GitHub](https://github.com/pprevos/R4H2O/tree/master/casestudy1) repository. Before we determine the relevant statistics, we need to load and explore the data. 

The code is available in the `casestudy1.R` file in the `casestudy1` folder. The best way to learn the material is to type all the examples and assignments in your file, run the code and explore the results. Playing with the code by trying different variations is the best way to become familiar with the vocabulary and syntax of any programming language.

X> Create a new R file for this case study in RStudio.
### Load the data
Before we start analysing this data, we need to load the Tidyverse collection of libraries. If we don't do this first, R will not recognise most of the functions we will be using.

The data is stored in a CSV file. The `read_csv()` function reads CSV files and stores them in a data frame.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
library(tidyverse)
turbidity <- read_csv("casestudy1/turbidity_laanecoorie.csv")
```

The text between quotation marks is the path to the file. Note that R uses the forward slash `/`, common in Unix systems, and not the Windows backslash (`\`) to form a path. The path is relative to the working directory. Every R session has a working directory, and all paths are relative to that folder. When you work in a project, RStudio saves the working directory for future sessions. 

You can find see the current working directory with the `getwd()` function. Without a working directory, you would have to specify the complete path, such as: `"C:/Users/peterp/R4H2O/session2/turbidity_laanecoorie.csv`. In this example, the working directory is `C:/Users/peterp/R4H2O/`.

The function assumes that the first row contains the field names and the following rows contain the data.

When you load the data, R shows the types of data in the table. In this example, we have six columns in various data formats. The double format are integers. The data also contains a data and some character values.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  Sample_No = col_double(),
  Date_Sampled = col_date(format = ""),
  Sample_Point = col_character(),
  Zone = col_character(),
  Result = col_double(),
  Units = col_character()
)
```

The turbidity data is now visible in the *Environment* tab. The turbidity variable is a data frame, which is a tabular set of data with rows (observations) and columns (variables), very much like a spreadsheet.

A data frame is a variable that holds tabular data, like in a spreadsheet. Within the Tidyverse, a data frame is called a *Tibble*. This quaint term is a reference to the New Zealand accent of the main developer of this software, Hadley Wickam.

The data is stored in rows and columns. Each column is a variable, which are called a data field or a parameter. Each row holds an observation or a measurement. The table below shows the start of a data frame with one row as an example.

| Sample_No | Date_Sampled | Sample_Point | Zone | Result | Units |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------|--------|-------|
| 1235      | 2019-12-01   | AB234        | Test | 0.30   | NTU   |

The data in this case study has the following fields:

* `Sample_No`: Reference number of the sample.
* `Date_Sampled`: The sampling date.
* `Sample_Point`: The reference number of the sample point.
* `Zone`: The zone within the water system.
* `Result`: The result of the laboratory test.
* `Units`: The units of the result (NTU).

Each of these variables within a data frame is a vector. All data frames are rectangular which means that all vectors in a data frame have the same length.

R can read many types of data. Some specialised extensions can connect R to Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases, scrape data from websites, and many other sources. The `extract_data.R` file in the case study folder shows how the turbidity data was extracted from a corporate SQL server, using the RODBC library.

Many organisations maintain spreadsheets as their single source of truth. If a spreadsheet is indeed your only solution to store data, you should stick to some simple rules to be able to easily use it in R, or any other data science package:

* Use only the top row as a header.
* Don't use colours to indicate values.
* Prevent using spaces in column names.
* Don't add any calculations in the data tab. 
* Every cell should be a data point or remain empty.

Following these guidelines, you can store your data in a clean way that simplifies analysing the results with R or any other analytical software.

### Inspect the data
The next step is to explore the data. When you type the name of the variable in the console, RStudio only displays the first ten rows. Any columns that don't fit on the screen are truncated.

The `names()` function displays the names of the columns as a vector of character strings. You can also use this function to rename the variables in a data frame.

The `dim()` function shows the number of rows and columns.

The `View()` function (note the capital V) opens the data in a separate read-only window. This function is the most convenient way to visually inspect the data. You can also view the data this way by clicking on the variable name in the Environment tab. You cannot edit the data, but you can sort the information by column by clicking on the variable name.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
names(turbidity)

dim(turbidity)

View(turbidity)
```

Q> Use the `nrow` and `ncol` functions to determine the size of the data frame.

Answer: The `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions list the number of rows and columns for a data frame. The result is a single number. The dim function shows both results in a vector of two numbers.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
nrow(turbidity)
ncol(turbidity)
```

Lastly, the `glimpse()` function provides a succinct overview of the fields in the data set, including the data types. When executing this function on the turbidity data we see:

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
> glimpse(turbidity)
Observations: 416
Variables: 6
$ Sample_No    <dbl> 5890125, 5890123, 5890124, 5765903, 5765904, 5734990, 55â¦
$ Date_Sampled <date> 2018-12-26, 2018-12-26, 2018-12-26, 2018-09-04, 2018-09â¦
$ Sample_Point <chr> "090D03", "090B09", "090C03", "090B08", "090C04", "090B0â¦
$ Zone         <chr> "Bealiba", "Dunolly", "Tarnagulla", "Dunolly", "Tarnagulâ¦
$ Result       <dbl> 0.10, 0.05, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10, 0.â¦
$ Units        <chr> "NTU", "NTU", "NTU", "NTU", "NTU", "NTU", "NTU", "NTU", â¦
```

You can also obtain this information by clicking on the triangle next to the variable name in the Environment tab in RStudio.

This overview contains a lot of information:
* Total number of observations (e.g. 416 laboratory test results)
* Total number of variables (e.g. 6 variables)
* Full list of the variables names (e.g. Sample_No, Zone ...)
* Data type of each variable (e.g. dbl (integer), date, characters)
* First few observations for each variable

### Explore the data
To view any of the variables within a data frame, you need to add the column name after a `$`, e.g. `turbidity$Result`. When you execute this command, R shows a vector of the selected variable. You can use this vector in calculations, as explained below.

If you want to use only a subset of a vector, you can indicate the index number between square brackets. For example: `turbidity$Results[1:10]` shows the first ten results.

R has various ways to view or analyse a subset of the data. The most basic approach is to add the number of the row and column between square brackets. For example, `turbidity[1:10, 4:5]` shows the first ten rows and the fourth and fifth variable. When there is no value in either the place for the rows or the columns, R shows all values. 

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
turbidity[, 4:5]  ## Show all rows with column four and five
turbidity[1:10, ] ## Show all variables for the first ten rows
```

This syntax can also include the names of variables, e.g. `turbidity[1:10, c("Zone", "Result")]` shows the first ten rows of the one and the result.

In summary, you can subset a vector data frame by adding an index number between square brackets. For vectors, you add one number to indicate the element number. For a data frame, you use two numbers: `[rows, columns]`. When you omit either the row or column number, R shows all available rows or columns.

Besides numerical values, you can also add formulas as indices. Please note that R is a mathematical language and the index numbers thus start at one. In generic programming languages, the index starts at zero. 

Q> What is the result of the last sample taken in the turbidity? Hint, use the `nrow()` function.

Answer: To find the last element of the data frame, use the `nrow()` function within square brackets.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
turbidity$Results[nrow(turbidity)]
```

You can also filter the data using conditions. If, for example, you like to see only the turbidity data for the Bealiba water quality zone, then you can use the `filter()` function from the dplyr package in the Tidyverse.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
turbidity[turbidity$Zone == "Bealiba", ]
filter(turbidity, Zone == "Bealiba")
```

The first method looks similar to what we discussed above. The row indicator now shows an equation. When you execute the line between brackets separately, you see a list of values that are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. These values indicate whether the variable at that location meets the condition. For example, the following code results in a vector with the values TRUE and FALSE.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
a <- 1:2
a == 1
```

Variables that are either TRUE or FALSE are called logical. These are useful to indicate conditions. These variables can also be used in calculations. The code below results in a vector with the values 2 and 0.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
a * 2
```

The second method uses the `filter()` function, which is more convenient than using square brackets. The first parameter in this function is the data frame, and the second parameter is the condition. Note that this method is tidier than the brackets method because we don't have to add the data frame name and `$` to the variables.

![`filter(df, var == "B"`](resources/session3/filter.png)

You can use all the common relational operators to test for conditions:

* `x < y` less than
* `x > y ` greater than
* `x <= y` less than or equal to
* `x >= y` greater than or equal to
* `x == y` equal to each other
* `x != y` not equal to each other

These relations result in a Boolean value of TRUE or FALSE, for example `1 > 2` results in `FALSE`. R also evaluates relations between character strings, using alphabetical order. In R, `"small" > "large"` results in TRUE because *b* comes before *l*.

When you apply these operators to a vector, then R assess all elements in the vector. The expression `c(2, 3) > 2` results in a vector with TRUE and FALSE as elements.

You can build elaborate conditionals by combining more than one condition with logical operations. Some of the most common options are:

* `! x`: not `x`$
* `x & y`: logical and (`x`$ AND `y`$)
* `x | y`: logical or (`x`$ OR `y`$)

An example of a logical operation would be the expression `"small" > "large" & 1 == 2`, which results in FALSE because the first condition is true, but the second one is false so they are not both true.

We can apply this knowledge to our case study to test subsets of the data:, `filter(turbidity, Zone == "Laanecoorie" & Result > 1)` shows the samples in the Laanecoorie zone with a result greater than 1 NTU. Note that testing for equality requires two equal signs.

Q> How many turbidity results in all zones, except Bealiba, are lower than 0.1 NTU?

Answer: We subset the data for all results less than 0.1 NTU and where the zone is not Bealiba. The nrow function counts the results.

{format: r, line-numbers: false}
```
nrow(filter(turbidity, Zone != "Bealiba" & Result < 0.1))
```

### Analyse the data
We need to numerically analyse the results to find the values to report to the regulator. R has extensive functionality to analyse data. We already saw the `mean()` function that calculates the arithmetic mean of a vector.

Q> What is the mean turbidity value for the samples in Bealiba?

Answer: Filter all results where the zone variable is Bealiba and calculate the mean of the `Results` variable.

{format: r, line-numbers: false} 
```
turbidity_bealiba <- filter(turbidity, Zone == "Bealiba")
mean(turbidity_bealiba$Result)
```

Another important function is `summary()` which shows six basic statistics: the minimum value, the first quartile, median, mean, third quartile and the maximum, for example:

{format: r, line-numbers: false} 
```
summary(turbidity$Result)

   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.0500  0.1000  0.2000  0.1789  0.2000  1.5000 
```

Q> What is the third quartile for the turbidity of sample point 090A01?

Answer: Filter the results for this sample point. Note that the new variable starts with a letter to avoid an error. The summary function provides the 75^th^ percentile of the results.

{format: r, line-numbers: false} 
```
p090a01 <- filter(turbidity, Sample_Point == "090A01")
summary(p090a01$Result)
```

The `summary()` function is useful for a quick overview, but not very useful in detailed analysis because it has little flexibility. The `quantile()` function calculates the percentiles of a vector of numbers. The default setting gives five values, similar to the `summary()` function. The quantile function can also take a vector of one or more probabilities to calculate different outcomes, for example `quantile(turbidity$Result, c(0.50, 0.95))` results in the following vector:

{line-numbers: false} 
```
50% 95% 
0.2 0.3
```

The regulator has specified that we need to calculate the 95^th^ percentile with the Weibull method. The quantile function has access to all nine formulas described by Hyndman & Fan (1996). As we saw above, the Weibull method is the sixth option, which we can pass as a parameter.

{format: r, line-numbers: false} 
```
quantile(turbidity$Result, 0.95, type = 6)
```

In this particular case, the results are not very skewed, so all methods provide the same result.

One last function to review is a convenient method to analyse subsets of the data. The `group_by()` function in the dplyr library splits the data into subsets. 

![Grouping a data frame with `group_by(df, var)`.](resources/session3/grouping.png)

We can use this special type of table to compute summary statistics for each group using the `summarise()` function. For example, to determine the maximum turbidity value for each water quality zone, we use:

{format: r, line-numbers: false} 
```
turb_zones <- group_by(turbidity, Zone)
summarise(turb_zones, Maximum = max(Result))
```

The first argument in this function is the data vector, and the second argument is a list of the grouping variables. In this case, we only have one, but it can be more. The `turb_zones` variable is a grouped table.

The `summarise()` function takes a grouped table as input and calculates relevant values over the groups. In the example above, we determine the maximum result for each zone.

We now have all the knowledge to answer the original question.

Q> What is the mean turbidity for each sample point?

## Quiz 1: Water Quality Regulations
The project folder for this case study includes a file named `gormsey.csv` with fictitious water quality data. 

The data is extracted from a real system but modified to provide more variability in the data. The names of the towns were randomly generated using the [Fantasy Names Generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/town_names.php) website. 

This file contains samples for turbidity, [Escherichia coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli) and [trihalomethanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trihalomethane) (THMs). E Coli is a coliform bacterium that can cause gastroenteritis. THMs are a group of chemical compounds that are predominantly formed as a by-product when chlorine is used to disinfect drinking water. Turbidity was described in detail earlier in the case study description.

The Victorian *Safe Drinking Water Regulations* sets limits for each of these three parameters:
* *Escherichia coli*: All samples of drinking water collected are found to contain no Escherichia coli per 100 millilitres of drinking water, except false positive samples.
* *Total trihalomethanes*: Less than or equal to 0.25 milligrams per litre of drinking water.
* *Turbidity*: The 95^th^ percentile of results for samples in any 12 months must be less than or equal to 5.0 Nephelometric Turbidity Units.

You can assume that all reported samples in the data are verified results.
