Managing reliable water services requires not only a sufficient volume of water but also significant amounts of data. Water professionals continuously measure the flow and quality of water and asses how customers perceive their service. Water utilities are awash, or even flooded with data. Data professionals use data pipelines and data lakes and make data flow from one place to another.

Data and water are, as such, natural partners. Professionals in the water industry rarely directly interact with water or customers, but they are constantly analysing data that describes these realities. Analysing data maintains or improves the level of service to customers and minimises the impact on the natural environment.

Most professionals use spreadsheets to collect and analyse data and present the results. While these tools are convenient, they are not ideal when working with large and complex sets of data. Specialists in data analysis prefer to write code in one of the many available computing languages.

This course introduces water utility professionals to the [R language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) for data science. This language is one of the most popular and versatile tools among data scientists to create value from data.

Other languages, such as Python, Stata or Julia are equally suitable to analyse data. Each programming language has its specific strength. The R language is a powerful tool to analyse and visualise data. The principles taught in this course are easily transferable to other languages.

The content of this course represents a steep learning curve because we take a deep dive into the functionalities of the R language. While this might sound daunting, keep in mind that: 

> The steeper the learning curve, the larger to payoff.

This course is not an exhaustive introduction into data science programming, but a teaser to inspire water professionals to ditch their spreadsheets and instead write code to analyse data. The best way to learn to solve problems with computer code is to start with practical examples and learn the principles as you progress through ever more complex cases.

This course discusses the basics of using the R language with a limited scope. This course does not include advanced techniques such as machine learning. All data used in this course is tabular, text analysis and other unstructured data are not part of the curriculum.

## Course Content
This course consists of an introduction and three case studies. Each of the case studies uses real-life examples that conclude with a practical data product. This approach quickly introduces you into using the R language, instead of lecturing on theoretical aspects of the language. Each part of the course concludes with a guided assignment. These assignments use multiple-choice quizzes to test your answers. Completed examples of all assignments are available in the course package in case you are stuck. The last section of the three case studies end with writing a real-life analysis of the data and producing a report. 

### Introduction
The first part introduces the principles of data science overall and using the R language. The last section is an assignment to write a script to convert water levels in an open channel to flows.

#### Principles of Data Science
This course is not only about the vocabulary and syntax of R, but also about doing good data science. The opening section of the course introduces a framework for best practice in analysing data and sharing the results. This framework derives from the book _Principles of Strategic Data Science_ by Peter Prevos. The three case studies each implement aspects of this framework.

#### Introduction to the R Language
Before we can start solving water problems, we need to introduce some principles of the language and how to use the software. 

#### Measuring Flows in Open Channels

### Case Study 1: Water Quality Monitoring

#### Introduction to the Tidyverse
The R language is as powerful as it is because it is very easy to extend its functionality. Many thousands of libraries are available for advanced analysis and extend the functionality of R. The Tidyverse is a collection of libraries designed for data science. This section introduces the Tidyverse and shows how to read a data file into memory and explore its content.

#### Visualising Data

#### Creating Data Products

### Case Study 2: Customer Experience

#### Analysing Customer Data
Most water professionals are used to analyse objective data obtained from scientific instruments. This section intrudes 

#### Cleaning Data

#### 

### Case Study 3: Digital Water Meters
