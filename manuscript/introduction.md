# R for Water Professionals
Dta 

This workshop starts with an introduction to working with R and R Studio using 

. Rather than describing the basics, readers are invited to use some of the many free resources to learn the basics before reading the case study.

## Prerequisites
To follow participate in this workshop, you need to have some understanding of the issues surrounding water management and experience with analysing data. Experience with writing computer code is helpful, but not required. 
### R and R Studio
You will also need access to a recent version of the R language and RStudio.

The best way to access the R language is by downloading the latest version from the website of the [R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that simplifies working with R and data. You can download a free version of this software from the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website. Follow the instructions on these websites to complete the installation. You will need to install the R language before you install the IDE.

Alternatively, you can sign-up for a free account to access the [cloud version](https://rstudio.cloud/) of R Studio. This account will give you full access to R Studio and R in your browser without the need to install software. The cloud version is fully functional but not very fast. Installing R and RStudio on your own laptop is the preferred method.

### Downloading the workshop material
If you are participating in the workshop, you can download the documents by clicking on the 'clone or download' button and unzip the files to your computer. You can open the RStudio project file to begin the workshop and start playing with the data and code.

For those using the cloud version of RStudio, click on the arrow next to the 'New Project' button and select 'New Project from GitHub Repo'. Copy the URL of this repository in the text field and hit enter. After a little while, RStudio will open the project.

If you understand how to use Git, then feel free to fork and clone the repository. Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you find errors or like to provide additional content.

# What is Data Science?
## Data Science Workflow

This course focuses on rectangular data, which are rows and columns of information as they are commonly stored in spreadsheets and databases. Unstructured data, such as text
## What is Good Data Science?
## Data Science Tools
The last ten years have seen an explosion of available data science tools. There is no one single tool that can do everything. Just like a trades-person uses each tool for a specific job, so does a data scientist use tools for specific tasks within the workflow.
### Spreadsheets
The most common tool to solve data problems are spreadsheets. They are a great product that combines storing data, writing and executing code and displaying output. Their versatility is also their Achilles heel. Spreadsheets have limited capabilities and some intrinsic constraints. Spreadsheets are very easy to build, but they are extremely difficult to reverse-engineer. We all would have had the unpleasant experience of trying to understand how a spreadsheet made by somebody else, or one that you did ages ago, actually functions. The biggest issue with spreadsheets is reproducibility of the analysis process.
[insert 5.5 reasons]
### Business Intelligence Systems
The software market is saturated with point-and-click business intelligence systems, such as Click, Tableau or Power BI. These tools are very user-friendly portals for end-users to consume data. Business intelligence tools are, however, not very suitable to analyse data. Their main strength is to present the results of analysis in a dynamic way. Analysing data is not just about visualisations. Good analysis reviews a lot of intermediate steps that are hidden from the end-user.

Another limitation of these systems is that they are limited to visualisations, without any meaningful capacity to include a narrative. Business intelligence are almost like a 'create your own adventure'. The user can choose how the system presents the data and thus create their owns stories. While a well-designed visualisations is, as they say, worth a thousand words, the complexity of the analytical process often needs a narrative to help the reader understand the purpose, method and conclusions. Limiting a data product to visualiations can quickly become data porn; easy to swallow but a bit naughty.
## Data science code
Writing computer code has long been the domain of information technology professionals. This view is not helped by stereotypes of coders as slightly eccentric geeks that prefer to communicate with their terminal instead of with people. The main objective of this course is to dispel this false idea and promote that water professionals should ditch their spreadsheets and learn how to write code.

For those that are used to developing spreadsheets, the jump to writing code is not as large as it might seem. Every formula in a spreadsheet is in essence a part of a computer program. Writing code is an essential component of 

There are almost as many computer languages as their are human ones. Many of these languages are suitable to analyse data and the list in this section only includes the most common ones. Some languages, such as Python, C or Java are general programming languages that can be used for any type of software. Other languages are developed specifically to manipulate and analyse data. 

The Structured Query Language (SQL, pronounced seequel) is a language to access and manipulate databases. Many varieties of SQL exist, but they all have great similarities. The main strength of SQL is its ability extract, transform and load data. The first version of this language was released in 1986 and it is a robust data interface. This language is not very good at actually analysing data because it does not include any higher-order mathematics.

Python is a general-purpose programming language that developers use to develop many types of applications. Python has many extensions with specialised data science functions. 

There are many other less common languages specialised such as Julia, Haskell, Fortran, Mathematica and so on.

This workshop uses the R language because it is designed to analyse data. The basic functionality of R includes many higher-order functions to undertake statistical analysis. R is not as fast as some other languages. This book is about the R langauge because the way it is structured is close to the way subject-matter-experts think about analysis, instead of the way computer scientists structure software.
