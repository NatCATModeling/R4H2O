# Creating Data Products: Analysing Water Consumption

## Literate Programming
Reproducibility is on of the most important requirements for good data science. 

Replication is the gold standard for science to ensure the quality of previous results. Replication involves repeating the experiments, which is a costly and complicated activity. The past few years, some areas of science have suffered from a replication crisis. Famous experiments in psychology and sociology are under a cloud of doubt because current researchers fail to replicate the findings. Some scientists were clearly fraudulent in their approach, changing data and manipulating the analytical process to obtain the desired results. Other scientists either used unrepresentative samples or misinterpreted the data and published wrong results. The peer review process did not identify these issues because the authors only provided the outcomes of their research, and the papers were published and accepted as truthful.

This crisis in some of the sciences has moved some journals to require authors to submit not only the written text but also the data and analytical code that was used to draw the conclusions. Releasing the data and the code strengthens peer review. These principles of reproducibility also apply to business analysis and ensure sound data science. Every study needs to be undertaken in such a way that a colleague or auditor can recreate the steps of the recipe that was followed to reach a conclusion.

The most effective method to achieve full reproducibility is to use literate programming. This method combines computer code with text so that the analysis becomes fully transparent. Although many systems exist that at first instance might seem more user-friendly than writing code, point-and-click systems have severe limitations, and the results are often difficult to verify.


## Measuring water consumption


## Case Study: Smart Meter Data
The case study for this session is a data simulated data set for digital metering. This data set provides a realistic example of 

The data for this case study is simulated for two reasons. Firstly, detailed information about the water consumption of consumers can reveal a lot of information about the lifestyle of the people in the house. The data reveals when people are home or not, it can indicate how many people lie in the house, their nightly toilet habits and so on. Secondly, simulating data is an effective way to test computational methods because we know the expected outcomes. The method that was used to simulate the data is discussed on the [Lucid Manager](https://lucidmanager.org/simulating-water-consumption/) website.
