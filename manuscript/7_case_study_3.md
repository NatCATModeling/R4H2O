## Case Study 3: Measuring Water Consumption {#casestudy3}
The case study for this session is a data simulated data set for digital metering. This data set provides a realistic example of 

The data for this case study is simulated for two reasons. Firstly, detailed information about the water consumption of consumers can reveal a lot of information about the lifestyle of the people in the house. The data reveals when people are home or not, it can indicate how many people lie in the house, their nightly toilet habits and so on. Secondly, simulating data is an effective way to test computational methods because we know the expected outcomes. The method that was used to simulate the data is discussed on the [Lucid Manager](https://lucidmanager.org/simulating-water-consumption/) website.
