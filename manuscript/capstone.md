# Capstone Project: Reporting Water Quality Performance

This capstone project sets a challenge for participants to help them.

## Further Study
This course only provides a cursor overview of the R language with as objective to motivate water professionals to ditch the spreadsheet and start writing code.

A great place to systematically learn about R is [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). This website provides free introduction courses and paid advanced courses. DataCamp also provides courses about other languages, such as Python, SQL and even spreadsheets.

For a thorough in-depth course on data science with the R language, I recommend the [Data Science Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) by John Hopkins University on the Coursera platform.


## Problem Statement
The Board of Directors of your water utility receives monthly updates about water quality performance. This report consists of a large table with water quality results 

[add table]

Another section of the report informs the Board about customer complaints, including negative experiences that customers have with water quality. The Board has asked the data science team to provide an integrated overview of water quality that they can understand.

None of the members of the board are technical experts

Create a dashboard for the monthly performance report 

## Available Data Sets
Two csv files are available in the `Capstone` folder on the [GitHub]() repository.

* `network.csv`: Various water quality parameters measured in six networks.
* `complaints.csv`: Complaints about water quality from six networks.

The data was extracted from six different water systems and covers one financial year (July -- June). The data has been manipulated to create more variety in the data. The names of the towns have been changed to prevent confusion with the actual data.

## Assignment
Your assignment is to create a new dashboard that visualises water quality perfomance
