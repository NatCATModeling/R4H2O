#### Convert data
When using the `str` function, you will note that the `Date_Sampled` field is a factor instead of a date field. A factor is a type of character variable that can be used in calculations, which falls outside the scope of this introduction to R. Using factors as a date is problematic because data cannot be ordered chronologically.

The `as.Date` function changes the factor into a proper date field that can be sorted chronologically and create a time series. R has many other functions to change the type of a variable, all of which start with `as.`.
