# R for Water Utility Professionals

Managing reliable water services requires not only a sufficient volume of water but also significant amounts of data. Water professionals continuously measure the flow and quality of the water and how customers perceive their service. Data and water are natural partners. Water utilities are awash, or even flooded with data. Data professionals use data pipelines and data lakes and cause data to flow from one place to another.

This GitHub repository contains the instructions, examples and data sets for an introduction to writing data science code for water professionals. This one-day workshop introduces participants to analysing data using the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for statistical computing.

This repository is a work-in-progress that will be completed in the second week of July 2019. The instructions for the course will be available as an ebook from the LeanPub website.
