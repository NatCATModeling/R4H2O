# Problem Statement
The regulator for water quality has released a new guideline that lowers the maximum guideline value for trihalomethanes at the customer tap to 0.15 mg/l. This report assesses the historical performance of the Gormsey water system to assess the risk of non-compliance assuming no operational changes are implemented.

# Methodology
This report uses data from the Gormsey system. The data is stored in a CSV file that contains the following data:

* `Sample_No`: Number of the sample
* `Date_Sampled`: Date the sample was taken
* `Sample_Point`: Sample point asset number
* `Zone`: Water quality zone
* `Measure`: Test type
* `Result`: Test result
* `Units`: Unit of the test result

The Gormsey data contains results for THMs, E Coli and Turbidity tests. Only the THM results are used. Table 1 shows the number of recorded THM results for each zone.

```{r}
gormsey <- read.csv("casestudy1/gormsey.csv")
gormsey_thm <- subset(gormsey, Measure == "THMs")

thm_zone <- aggregate(list(Samples = gormsey_thm$Sample_No), list(Sample = gormsey_thm$Zone), length)

kable(thm_zone, caption = "Table 1: Number of THM results per zone.")
```

# Analysis
The data shows that the Wakefield, Tarnstead and Strathmore zones show high levels of THMs over the past year, with one sample at the new maximum. The Merton system shows two outliers that have clearly exceed the current and the new limit.

```{r, dpi = 300, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(gormsey_thm, aes(Zone, Result)) + 
    geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue", col = "dodgerblue4") + 
    coord_flip() + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = c(0.20, 0.25), col = "red", linetype = "longdash") + 
    labs(title = "Distribution of THM results Gormsey System",
        subtitle = "New limit: 20.20 mg/l")

kable(subset(gormsey_thm, Result > 0.20), row.names = FALSE, 
      caption = "Table 2: Results exceeding the new limit.")
```

# Discussion and Recommendation
The level of risk of non-compliance with the water quality regulations is only slightly elevated under the new guideline value for THMS. Current outliers are also above the existing maximum of 0.25 mg./l. 

The data shows many outliers in the observations. Further investigation is required to determine the cause of the high variability in the data.
