# Problem Statement
This reports presents the turbidity trends for the past two years.

The Laanecoorie system contains of four zones: `r unique(turbidity$Zone)`.

# Methodology
::::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
The data was extracted from the laboratory results in the data warehouse. The samples are taken from customer taps in the sytem. Each zone is samples twice each week.

# Exploratory Analysis
```{r}
by_zone <- group_by(turbidity, Zone)
turbidity_summary <- summarise(by_zone, Min = min(Result),
                               Mean = mean(Result),
                               p95 = quantile(Result, .95, type = 6))
kable(turbidity_summary, digits = 2, caption = "Summary of turbidity results.")
```

# Turbidity Trends
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
ggplot(turbidity, aes(Date_Sampled, Result)) + 
    geom_smooth() + 
    geom_line() + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 1, col = "Red") + 
    facet_wrap(~Zone, ncol = 1) + 
    labs(x = "Date Sampled", y = "Turbidity [NTU]")
```

# Conclusions
```{r}
spikes <- filter(turbidity, Result >1)
```

1. Flat trend in tubdity.
2. `r nrow(spikes)` spike(s) greater then 1 NTU in `r unique(spikes$Zone)`.
